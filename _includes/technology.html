      <h3><u>What is a Stirling Engine</h3></u>
      <p>
        Robert Stirling patented the first hot air engine with a regenerator in the early 19th century.  In the diagram you are able to see the theoretical constructs that constitute a Stirling engine.  Physics gas laws states that as gas heats it expands.  As the gas in the lower chamber heats it expands.  Because of this expansion the displacer piston is moved.  With proper seals there is also a chamber for cold gas.  This cold gas fights back against the expanding hot gas and forces the displacer piston back to the hot gas.  This process will continue over and over again assuming that you can keep the balance of hot gas and cold gas.  With this constant process you move the power piston creating mechanical energy.

      <p>
      Once you have mechanical energy you can turn a gear or attach an alternator and produce electricity.   As you can see from the diagram StirMoCorp will use consumers pool water to keep the cool gas cold and use natural gas to keep the hot gas heated.  In this process the pool water used to keep the cool gas cold will warm and be circulated back into the pool for consumer’s enjoyment!

       <h3><u>Our Patent-Pending Technology</h3></u>
         </p>
        Over time internal combustion engines, and electric motors have displaced nearly all Stirling engine applications. However, due to its high efficiency and other attributes, the Stirling is making a comeback. Our technology is based on our implementation of a gamma-configuration Stirling engine. (US patent 13949795- Stirling Engine with Regenerator Internal to the Displacer Piston and Integral Geometry for Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow). This state of the art technological advancement will utilize a displacer piston with new pin fin heater head and cooling system applications. This Stirling engine will be more efficient than other Stirlings by removing heater tubes which have traditionally been the fault of many designs. StirMoCorp also will test high performance ceramics to improve efficiency.  By modestly seeking to achieve 25% thermal efficiency with lower costing components this prototype would be able to save consumers substantially. If utilizing state of the art expensive materials such as high performance ceramics, then thermal efficiency could reach up to 40%.</strong>

First prototype models will be 1.5hp, 3hp, 5hp, and 10hp engines. Our Below video shows our patent pending technology with our complete graphical animations of sold works drawing software. We wish to take this animation and make it a reality.
