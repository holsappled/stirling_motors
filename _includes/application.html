    <h2><u>Theoretical Example of a StirMoCo used in Residential Pool Systems</u></h2>
<p>   
    StirMoCorp will use liquid pumping applications as its first implementation of the new patented Stirling engine.  With high electricity prices and low natural gas costs it is economical for consumers to purchase the product.  Consumers are projected to earn their initial investment in the product back in 2.5 years from utilities savings.  Electric pool pumps have been targeted as the initial market due to their overconsumption of energy.  Electric motors are efficient but there is a more economical way to circulate liquid. Circulating water is not a mechanically complicated issue.
<p>
    The average pool needs to run an electric pump for 5 to 6 hours depending on the time of the year.  The most state of the art electric pool pumping systems utilize the variable speed electric pool pump. Most pool systems have not upgrade to this pump.  The variable speed pool pump advertises dramatic savings for pool owners.  What they don’t take into account is the fact that the average pool only needs a 1.5hp motor that runs for 5 to 6 hours a day depending on the pool size.  It is not cost effective to buy the initial high cost variable pool pump with the ratio between savings and depreciation of the pump.  Solar heated pools would also be at a disadvantage to StirMoCorp’s Stirling engine pool pump.  If you have a solar heating pool system on the roof consumers must continuously run their pump to circulate the water during peak energy hours to maximize warmth from the sun.  Homeowners are now running their energy draining pump for longer than 5 to 6 hours to get the cool water onto the roof when the sun heats the water best.  If consumers are in this situation it may be economical to purchase a variable speed pool pump to help remedy their electrical consumption.  With an average solar pool heater system at $5,500 and the average variable pool pump at $1,200 a pool owner needs to purchase both to have an economic utility bill.  The depreciation of both products may be too short to see a return on the initial investment of these two products.  The market size increases with 1/5 houses that do not qualify for solar water heating due to their topography.  StirMoCo engine will be projected to be priced as much as the variable speed pool pump but more expensive than a traditional electric pool pump.  It would seem that the variable speed pool pump would keep the StirMoCo pool pump from entering the market due to its efficiency and established trademark.  The StirMoCo engine however in addition to lowering utility consumption like the variable speed pool pump will also have the ability to heat consumers’ pools at no additional cost. 
<p>
    By utilizing natural gas infrastructure our patented Stirling engine can replace the electric pool pump motor.  The patented technology also has the added bonus of heating the pool with no additional cost. As you can see in the diagram the pool system uses a boiler that runs off natural gas to heat the pool.  The patented technology runs off this same natural gas.   StirMoCorp technology is projected to run 25%-40% thermal efficiency.  For example, if a 25% thermal efficiency engine burning natural gas was running the pool pump then there is 75% wasted heat.  With StirMoCorp’s current design we plan to take this 75% wasted heat and use it to heat the pool.  The design will achieve this through circulating the water through the cooling unit thus making the cool gas colder and thus heat the water.
<p>
    In this application it may be beneficial and cost effective to design a Stirling engine at 25% thermal efficiency with the added bonus of heating the pool with 75% thermal dedicated to water heating.  Although producing efficiency is important for future applications this situation only calls for circulating water.  The added bonus of heating your pool is attractive to consumers and therefore may be worthwhile to design a Stirling engine with lower costing materials to produce less efficiency.  This will reduce the initial purchasing price for consumers and increase the temperature of the pool.  If decided to use expensive high performance ceramics at 40% thermal efficiency, then only 60% waste heat could be used to heat the pool.  Although the consumer would save by using less natural gas the pool may not achieve desired temperature.  All these considerations are dependent upon StirMoCorp’s stress, field, and reliability testing of the first prototype.

    <h2><u>Thermodynamics of Savings</u></h2>
<BR>
<p>
	We will make two different calculations in how StirMoCorp’s patented technology will save consumers on monthly utility bills and have the added bonus of heating their pool at no additional cost.  The calculations will use a recent utilities bill rate in San Diego and show how consumers can eventually pay back the initial cost of the StirMoCo in the course of 2.5 years with utilities bill savings. 
<p>
    In this example we will utilities consumption from San Diego Gas and Electric for December 2015 rates in the inland region.  In SDG&E’s price breakdown consumers are charged at different tier systems depending on consumption.  For example, if you use 346kWh then you are charged $.17 per KwH.  After 346kWh you are now charged at a rate of $.20 per kWh being tier 2 until you reach 450kWh.  After 450kWh you are now charged $.39 per kWh being in tier 3.  Most households that own a pool hit tier 3 every month with electrical consumption.
<p>    
	Natural gas also has a tier system measured in Therms.  This system has two tiers.  Tier 1 allows for the use of 49 Therms at $.87 per Therm.  After tier 1 Therms are priced at $1.06 per Therm in tier 2.  Most households with pools overflow to tier 2 charges.
<p>    
	To be conservative in this calculation we will calculate consumption in both Tier 1 electrical rates and Tier 1 natural gas rates.  We will also calculate tier 3 electrical and tier 2 natural gas rates.
<p>    
	Before we start calculating we need to make some conversions… 
<p>    
    1 Therm of natural gas = 29.3001 kWh
<p>    
    1.5 Horse Power (HP) = 1.11855 kWh
<BR>
<p>
    Let us now measure how much a 1.5HP 25% thermal efficiency StirMoCo engine will consume in a 30-day period running for 6hrs a day.  
<BR>
<p>
    First account for 1.5HP running at 25% thermal efficiency 
    1.11855kWh * 4 = 4.4742 kWh 
    4.4742kWh * 6 hrs = 26.8452 kWh per day
    26.8452kWh * 30 days = 805.356 kWh per month running at 25% thermal efficiency
<BR>
<p>
    805.356kWh * 1 Therm/29.001 kWh = <b>27.76 Therms per month</b>
<BR>
<p>
    Let us now do a similar problem and figure out how much a 1.5 HP electric motor consumes in a 30-day period.  We give electric pool pumps the advantage in this calculation giving them 100% efficiency.  
<BR>
<p>
    1.5HP = 1.11855kWh
<p>
    1.11855Wh * 6hrs = 6.7113kWh per day
<p>
    6.7113kWh *30 = <b>201.339kWh per day</b>
<p>
    Now let’s review the savings related to SDG&E’s utility prices. 
<BR>

    StirMoCorp is projected to improve the thermal efficiency of the engine with the proper build and testing of the prototype.  StirMoCorp believes they can achieve 40% thermal efficiency with higher costing parts for future applications.  Using the example above StirMoCorp has predicted total consumer costs related to thermal efficiency for pool pump systems.

<p>
    <img src="http://stirlingmotorscorp.com/assets/color/pool_pump_thermal.jpg">
<p>    
    <b><u>Savings of 1.5HP Stirling Engine Pool Pump vs. 1.5HP Electrical Pool Pump for Tier 3 electrical cost vs. Tier 2 Natural Gas cost for SDG&E Utility prices for 12/2015<br>
    (HIGH energy use households that fall in Tier 3 and tier 2 gas and electric)</u></b>
<BR>
<p>
    As you can see the savings from a theoretical thermodynamic level are realistic.  These calculations can be applied to other liquid pumping industries when replacing electric liquid pumps.  In 2014 the average residence in San Diego consumed 355.52 Therms and 6,847.09kWh per year.   This is 29.63 Therms and 570.59kWh per month.  This means that the average residence in San Diego is already in Tier 3 for electrical consumption and well below the threshold of Tier 2 gas consumption at 49 Therms.  Although there is a mixture of Tiers when calculating savings, the objective of every household should be to keep their electrical consumption below Tier 3.  What should be taken from these charts above are the extreme lows and highs of savings.
<p>    
    If a household has already installed a photovoltaic(solar) system and are below tier 1 electrical then they will be at the opposite of the savings spectrum being $36.48.  If that household has a photovoltaic system that is running their meter backward then they would be losing money purchasing the StirMoCo engine pool pump as their household is producing more energy than it consumes.  This consumer may be interested in the ability for the Stirling to heat their pool year round but would not be an economical choice for that household.  We applaud those individuals that have taken the initiative to install solar systems on their households and make a green tomorrow today but we at StirMoCorp realize the financial burden this may cost.  The average solar installation ranges from $25,000-$35,000 and is unrealistic for most households with other expenditures.  There are government subsidies and loaner programs that are offered to make this large initial cost more reasonable but will not last forever.  With the depreciation value of the solar panel and the government subsidy which was extended from the end of 2016 to the end of 2019 solar systems will begin to become out of reach financially for most households. StirMoCorp hopes to answer the call to these households.  With 1/5 houses already not qualifying for solar due to topography there is the potential for these houses to maximize savings with the StirMoCo pool pump.  These houses have no alternative energy producing systems to remedy electrical consumption will fall into tier 3.  If consumers fall into tier 3 then they can maximize savings by purchasing the StirMoCo pool pump.  Depending on the development and testing of the prototype consumers can save $398.88 a year with a 25% thermal efficiency engine from a theoretical thermodynamic standpoint in San Diego for 12/2015 rates. 
<p>  
    Savings increase as thermal efficiency increases.  The barriers to entry in this market would be low due to the technological advancement of the patented Stirling engine and the saving that customers will see after the purchase of the initial product.  StirMoCorp finds the pool pump application to be the most scalable from an engineering and marketing perspective.  StirMoCorp has determined that the barriers set up by the electric variable pool pump are not substantial enough to keep the Stirling pool pump out of the market.  The electric variable speed pool pump cannot save and heat consumers pools.  StirMoCorp has found a niche in this market and is awaiting seed funding to begin building process of the prototype.
<p>
        <h2><u>Thermodynamics of Heating your Pool with Stirmoco</u></h2>
<p>
    In our example we will be using a 20,000 gal pool that will be utilizing a 25% thermal efficient 1.5HP Stirmoco engine running for 6 hours a day.  Pool owners typically run their pool pump systems 5 to 6 hours a day depending on the time of year to achieve optimum filtration.  We will show with our calculations how the 1.5 HP Stirmoco will utilize the 75% heat loss to be an added bonus of heating the pool at no additional cost.
<p>    
    First we must understand the heat capacity of water for a 20,000gal pool…
<p>    
    Cp (Heat capacity of water) = (1BTU)/(Lbs. of Mass)
<p>    
<BR>
<BR>
    20,000gal (Pool size) * 8lbs. per gal.(water weighs 8 lbs. per gal) = 160,000BTU per Fahrenheit
<p>    
    Now we will run the calculation of the 1.5 HP Stirmoco pool pump
<p>      
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5HP = 1.1185 KW 
<p>     
    Remember that this engine is running at 25% thermal efficiency and leaving 75% waste heat.
<p>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1185 KW * Waste Heat (3) = 3.3555 KW 
<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3555 KW * 6 hours a day = 20.133 kWh per day
<p>    
    Now we must convert kWh into BTU
<p>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 kWh = 3412.14 BTU
<p>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.133 kWh * 3412.14 = 68,696.6146 BTU
<p>    
    Now take the heat capacity for a 20,000gal pool and determine how many degrees a day the pool temperature will rise…
 <p>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68,696.6146 BTU / 160,000 BTU per Fahrenheit = .43 degrees a day
 <p>     
    <b><u>1.5HP 25% Thermal Efficiency Stirmoco Stirling Engine running for 6hrs per day</u></b>
 <p>     
     <img src="http://stirlingmotorscorp.com/assets/color/Pool_size_BTU.jpg">
<p>     
    Although these numbers are not a substantial increase in pool temperature there is many ways that the pool owner can take advantage.  By being proactive with reducing the dissipation of heat from the pool an owner can see a substantial increase in pool temperature.  Dependent upon weather conditions and the seasons pool owners can see the temperature of their pool increase by 10°F–20°F with proper pool covering after a period of about a month.  It is important to realize that this chart was generated with the thought that a 40,000gal pool will run a 1.5HP for 6 hours.  In this allotted time a 40,000gal pool would not be filtered properly.  The larger the pool the larger the running time of the pump.  The pool owner would have to run his own analysis to determine what the optimum run time for his pump to be.  By quickly altering the calculation above you will be able to find the temperature increase for your pool pump run time.  Many environmental factors impact a pools temperature.
<p>        
    Swimming pools lose energy in a variety of ways, but evaporation is by far the largest source of energy loss. Evaporating water requires tremendous amounts of energy. It only takes 1 BTU to raise 1 pound of water 1 degree, but each pound of 80ºF water that evaporates takes a whopping 1,048 Btu of heat out of the pool.
<p>   
    The evaporation rate from an outdoor pool varies depending on the pool's temperature, air temperature and humidity, and the wind speed at the pool surface. The higher the pool temperature and wind speed and the lower the humidity, the greater the evaporation rate.
<p>     
    Pool covers minimize evaporation from both outdoor and indoor pools. Covering a pool when it is not in use is the single most effective means of reducing pool heating loss. Savings of heat from 50%–70% are possible with proper implementation.
<p>

<p>     
    <img src="http://stirlingmotorscorp.com/assets/color/Outdoor_Pool_Loss.jpg">
<p>    
    Although we are not advertising a pool heating system we allow for the increase of the pool temperature of about 10°F–20°F as a side effect to the energy savings home owners get form an electric pool pump.  StirMoCo may determine to avoid pool heating applications once field testing is completed to focus on increased thermal efficiency to lower utility costs if field testing of pool heating applications fail.  This is a decision that will come later down the road after the development of the StirMoCo prototype.
<p>
    <h2><u>Food for Thought about this Engine</u></h2>
<p>     
    Before the extension of the government subsidy to 2019 the home solar installation industry was expecting a 70% drop in the market at the end of 2016.  This is one of the reasons why the subsidy was extended to 2019.  Similar numbers are being predicted for the end of 2019 unless there is a technological breakthrough for solar panels since the economies of scale is already in place with China as the major manufacturer.  China is the major manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.  The production of these panels is hazardous to the environment.  Although solar is creating cleaner air it is polluting streams and land in China where environmental regulations are much more relaxed.  This current industry is not creating a green tomorrow today but rather cleaning one mess and creating another.  The solar industry needs a technological advancement much like the silicon chip for the development of software.  At the moment there is no affordable technology that will allow for the initial cost of installation of solar without a government subsidy to be a viable option for the average household. The pursuit of affordable alternative energies for every household should be explored.
<p>     
    With natural gas becoming cheaper with new fracking techniques households can expect to see cheaper natural gas prices.   This makes savings for the Stirling engine increase with the forecast of lower natural gas prices.  The United States has some of the largest reserves of natural gas in the world. This is the projected future fuel source in the United States.  This will alleviate the United States dependency on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gases to more sustainable levels.  As stated before the Stirling engine has low emissions with the equivalent being that of a household water heater. 
<p>   
    The U.S Energy Information Administration observed 4,093 billion kWh of electricity in 2014.  Of this energy produced the top three fuel sources were coal (39%), natural gas (27%), and nuclear (19%).
<p> 
    Major energy sources and percent share of total U.S. electricity generation in 2014:
<p>   
    <li>Coal = 39%</li>
    <li>Natural gas = 27%</li>
    <li>Nuclear = 19%</li>
    <li>Hydropower = 6%</li>
    <li>Other renewables = 7%</li>
    <li>Biomass = 1.7%</li>
    <li>Geothermal = 0.4%</li>
    <li>Solar = 0.4%</li>
    <li>Wind = 4.4%</li>
    <li>Petroleum = 1%</li>
    <li>Other gases < 1%</li>
<BR>
<p>
    As you can tell the most urgent concern in reducing greenhouse gases should be the illumination of coal as a fuel source.  Although there are clean burning coal plants there will be a continued rise in global warming levels.  Natural gas is rising as the next available fuel source as it has relatively low emissions and can replace coal burning plants.  Natural gas has an infrastructure already in place and the supply is increasing due to new fracking techniques.  This will reduce demand and make natural gas prices even lower to consumers.  It would be in the world’s best interest to switch to other renewables but as you can see by the power produced in 2014 it would be an unrealistic expenditure in the current finances of the United States.  Stirling engines can also run off of solar as a heat source.  As with most paradigm shifts there is a multistep process that does not happen overnight.  The next step in our shift of energy production will be through natural gas.  StirMoCorp plans to answer this next step with our first application of the pool pump.  Other applications utilizing natural gas to improve home and industrial efficiency can be applied using this engine.
<p>    
    With the prediction that this new patent technology engine can run at higher thermal efficiency than other Stirling engines, StirMoCorp plans to sell directly to OEMs.  With higher thermal efficiency companies that already use Stirling engines can see better efficiency by implementing our engine and purchase directly from OEMs.  Such technologies that utilize Stirling engines in their products are refrigeration units, HVAC systems, micro-CHP units, and photovoltaic systems.  Not all these systems use natural gas as their fuel source which makes the Stirling engine a stepping stone into the renewable energy production field with no harmful environmental impacts.  The market potential is virtually endless with the adaptability of the Stirling engine into almost every energy producing field.
<p>    
    As the world continues to move toward a more renewable energy source StirMoCorp wishes its patent technology will help in this effort.  StirMoCorp is ready to facilitate a paradigm shift in energy production and improve home and industrial efficiency.  It is our intent to make a green tomorrow today.
