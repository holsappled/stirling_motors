    <h2><u>Our First Application</u></h2>
<p>   
    StirMoCorp will use the pool pumping application as its first implementation of the new patented Stirling engine.  With high electricity prices and low natural gas costs it is economical for consumers to purchase the product.  Consumers are projected to earn their initial investment in the product back in 2.5 years from utilities savings.  Electric pool pumps have been targeted as the initial market due to their overconsumption of energy.  Electric motors are efficient but there is a more economical way to circulate pool water. Circulating water is not a mechanically complicated issue.
<p>
    The average pool needs to run a pump for 5 to 6 hours depending on the time of the year.  The most state of the art electric pool pumping system is known as a variable speed electric pool pump. Most pool systems have not upgrade to this pump.  The variable speed pool pump advertises dramatic savings for pool owners.  What they don’t take into account is the fact that the average pool only needs a 1HP motor that runs for 5 to 6 hours a day depending on the pool size.  It is not cost effective to buy the initial high cost variable pool pump with the ratio between savings and depreciation of the pump.  Solar heated pools are also at a disadvantage to StirMoCorp’s Stirling engine pool pump.  If you have a solar heating pool system on your roof you must continuously run your pump to circulate the water during peak energy hours.  Homeowners are now running their energy draining pump for longer than 5 to 6 hours to get the cool water onto the roof when the sun heats the water best.  If you are in this situation it may be economical to purchase a variable speed pool pump to help remedy the electrical consumption.  With an average solar pool heater system at $5,500 and an average variable pool pump at $1,200 the average pool owner needs to purchase both to have a economical utility bill.  The depreciation of both products may be too short to see a return on the initial investment of these two products.  The market size increases with 1/5 houses that do not qualify for solar water heating due to their topography with shadows casted upon their roof.  It is a high cost to heat your pool and save on monthly electric bills.  The Stirling engine will be projected to be as much as a variable speed pool pump but more expensive than a traditional electric pool pump.  It would seem that the variable speed pool pump would keep the Stirling pool pump form entering the market due to its efficiency and established trademark.  The Stirling engine however in addition to lowering utility consumption like the variable speed pool pump will also have the ability to heat consumers’ pools at no additional cost. 
<p>
    By utilizing the natural gas infrastructure, a our patented Stirling engine can replace the electric pool pump motor.  The patented technology also has the added bonus of heating the pool with no additional cost. As you can see in the diagram the pool system uses a boiler that runs off natural gas to heat the pool.  The patented technology runs off this same natural gas.   StirMoCorp technology is projected to run 25%-40% thermal efficiency.  For example, if a 25% thermal efficiency engine burning natural gas was running the pool pump then there is 75% wasted heat.  With StirMoCorp’s current design we plan to take this 75% wasted heat and use it to heat the pool.  The design will achieve this through circulating the water through the cooling unit thus making the cool gas colder and heating the water.
<p>
    In this application it may be beneficial and cost effective to design a Stirling engine at 25% thermal efficiency with the added bonus of heating the pool with 75% thermal dedicated to water heating.  Although producing efficiency is important for future applications this situation only calls for circulating water.  The added bonus of heating your pool is attractive to consumers and therefore may be worthwhile to design a Stirling engine with lower costing materials to produce less efficiency.  This will reduce the initial purchasing price for consumers and increase the temperature of the pool.  If decided to use expensive high performance ceramics at 40% thermal efficiency, then only 60% waste heat could be used to heat the pool.  Although the consumer would save by using less natural gas the pool may not achieve desired temperature.  All these considerations are dependent upon StirMoCorp’s stress testing, field testing, and reliability testing of the first prototype.

    <h2><u>Thermodynamics of Savings</u></h2>
<BR>
<p>
	We will make two different calculations in how StirMoCorp’s patented technology will save consumers on monthly utility bills and heat their pool at no additional cost.  The calculations will use a recent utilities bill rate in San Diego and show how consumers can eventually pay back the initial cost of the Stirling motor in the course of 2.5 years with utilities bill savings.
<p>
    In this example we will utilities consumption from San Diego Gas and Electric for December 2015 rates in the inland region.  In SDG&E’s price breakdown consumers are charged at different tier systems depending on consumption.  For example, if you use 346kWh then you are charged $.17 per KwH.  After 346kWh you are now charged at a rate of $.20 per kWh being tier 2 until you reach 450kWh.  After 450kWh you are now charged $.39 per kWh being in tier 3.  Most households that own a pool hit tier 3 every month with electrical consumption.
<p>    
	Natural gas also has a tier system measured in Therms.  This system has two tiers.  Tier 1 allows for the use of 49 Therms at $.87 per therm.  After tier 1 Therms are priced at $1.06 per Therm in tier 2.  Most households with pools hit tier 2 charges.
<p>    
	To be conservative in this calculation we will calculate consumption in both Tier 1 electrical rates and Tier 1 natural gas rates.  We will also calculate tier 3 electrical and tier 2 natural gas rates.
<p>    
	Before we start calculating we need to make some conversions… 
<p>    
    1 Therm of natural gas = 29.3001 kWh
<p>    
    1 Horse Power (HP) = 0.75 kWh
<BR>
<p>
    Let us now measure how much a 1HP 25% thermal efficiency StirMoCorp Stirling engine will consume in a 30-day period running for 6hrs a day.  
<BR>
<p>
    First account for 1 HP running at 25% thermal efficiency 
    .745kWh * 4 = 2.98 kWh 
    2.98kWh * 6 hrs = 18 kWh per day
    18kWh * 30 days = 560 kWh per month running at 25% thermal efficiency
<BR>
<p>
    560kWh * 1 Therm/29.001 kWh = <b>19.1 Therms per month</b>
<BR>
<p>
    Let us now do a similar problem and figure out how much a 1HP electric motor consumes in 30-days.  We give electric pool pumps the advantage in this calculation giving them 100% efficiency.  
<BR>
<p>
    1HP = .745kWh
<p>
    .745kWh * 6hrs = 4.47kWh per day
<p>
    4.47kWh *30 = <b>135kWh per day</b>
<p>
    Now lets review the savings related to SDG&E’s utility prices.

    StirMoCorp is projected to improve the thermal efficiency of the engine with the proper build and testing of the prototype.  StirMoCorp believes they can achieve 40% thermal efficiency with higher costing parts for future applications.  Using the example above StirMoCorp has predicted total consumer costs related to thermal efficiency for pool pump systems.

<BR>.......
<BR>
<p>
    As you can see the savings from a theoretical thermodynamic level are realistic.  In 2014 the average residence in San Diego consumed 355.52 Therms and 6,847.09kWh per year.   This is 29.63 Therms and 570.59kWh per month.  This means that the average residence in San Diego is already in Tier 3 for electrical consumption and well below the threshold of Tier 2 gas consumption at 49 Therms.  Although there is a mixture of Tiers when calculating savings, the objective of every household should be to keep their electrical consumption below Tier 3.  What should be taken from these charts above are the extreme lows and highs of savings.
<p>    
    For example, if a household has already installed a photovoltaic(solar) system and are below tier 1 electrical then they will be at the opposite of the savings spectrum being $36.48.  If that household has a photovoltaic system that is running their meter backward then they would be losing money purchasing the Stirling engine pool pump as their household is producing more energy than it consumes and would save no money on their utility bills.  This consumer may be interested in the ability for the Stirling to heat their pool year round but would not be an economical choice for that household.  We applaud those individuals that have taken the initiative to install solar systems on their households and make a green tomorrow today but we at StirMoCorp realize the financial burden this may cost.  The average solar installation ranges from $25,000-$35,000 and is unrealistic for most households with other expenditures.  There are government subsidies and loaner programs that are offered to make this large initial cost more reasonable but will not last forever.  With the depreciation value of the solar panel and the government subsidy which was extended form the end of 2016 to the end of 2019 solar systems will begin to become out of reach financially for most households. StirMoCorp hopes to answer the call to these households.  With 1/5 houses already not qualifying for solar due to topography of shaded regions there is the potential for these houses to maximize savings with the Stirling pool pump.  With these houses with no alternative energy producing system to remedy electrical consumption will fall into tier 3.  If consumers fall into tier 3 then they can maximize savings by purchasing the Stirling pool pump.  Depending on the development and testing of the prototype consumers can save $398.88 a year with a 25% thermal efficiency engine from a theoretical thermodynamic standpoint in San Diego for 12/2015 rates. 
<p>  
    Savings increase as thermal efficiency increases.  The barriers to entry in this market would be low due to the technological advancement of the patented Stirling engine and the saving that customers will see after the purchase of the initial product.  StirMoCorp finds the pool pump application to be the most scalable from an engineering and marketing perspective.  StirMoCorp has determined that the barriers set up by the electric variable pool pump are not substantial enough to keep the Stirling pool pump out of the market.  The electric variable speed pool pump can not save and heat consumers pools.  StirMoCorp has found a niche in this market and is awaiting seed funding to begin building process of the prototype.

    <h2><u>Food for Thought about this Engine</u></h2>
<p>     
    Before the extension of the government subsidy to 2019 the home solar installation industry was expecting a 70% drop in the market at the end of 2016. This is one of the reasons why the subsidy was extended to 2019.  Similar numbers are being predicted for the end of 2019 unless there is a technological breakthrough for solar panels making them affordable for households.  The solar industry needs a technological advancement much like the silicon chip for the development of software.  At the moment there is no affordable technology that will allow for the initial cost of installation of solar without a government subsidy to be a viable option for the average household. The pursuit of affordable alternative energies for every household should be explored.
<p>     
    With natural gas becoming cheaper with new fracking techniques households can expect to see cheaper natural gas prices. This makes savings for the Stirling engine increase with the forecast of lower natural gas prices.  The United States has some of the largest reserves of natural gas in the world. This is the projected future fuel source in the United States.  This will alleviate the United States dependency on foreign oil and reduce greenhouse gases to more sustainable levels.  As stated before the Stirling engine has low emissions with the equivalent being that of a household water heater.
<p>   
    The U.S Energy Information Administration observed 4,093 billion kWh of electricity in 2014.  Of this energy produced the top three fuel sources were coal (39%), natural gas (27%), and nuclear (19%).
<p> 
    Major energy sources and percent share of total U.S. electricity generation in 2014:
<p>   
    <li>Coal = 39%</li>
    <li>Natural gas = 27%</li>
    <li>Nuclear = 19%</li>
    <li>Hydropower = 6%</li>
    <li>Other renewables = 7%</li>
    <li>Biomass = 1.7%</li>
    <li>Geothermal = 0.4%</li>
    <li>Solar = 0.4%</li>
    <li>Wind = 4.4%</li>
    <li>Petroleum = 1%</li>
    <li>Other gases < 1%</li>
<BR>
<p>
    As you can tell the most urgent concern in reducing greenhouse gases should be the illumination of coal as a fuel source.  Although there are clean burning coal plants there will be a continued rise in global warming levels.  Natural gas is rising as the next available fuel source as it is relatively low emissions and can replace coal burning plants.  Natural gas has an infrastructure already in place and the supply is increasing due to new fracking techniques.  This will reduce demand and make natural gas even lower to consumers.  It would be in the world’s best interest to switch to other renewables but as you can see by the power produced in 2014 it would be an unrealistic expenditure in the current finances of the United States.  As with most paradigm shifts there is a multistep process that does not happen overnight.  The next step in our shift of energy production will be through natural gas.  StirMoCorp plans to answer this next step with our first application of the pool pump.  Other applications utilizing natural gas to improve home and industrial efficiency can be applied using this engine.
<p>    
    With the prediction that this new patent technology engine can run at higher thermal efficiency than other Stirling engines, StirMoCorp plans to sell directly to OEMs.  With higher thermal efficiency companies that already use Stirling engines to save consumers money can see better efficiency by implementing our engine and purchase directly from OEMs.  Such technologies that utilize Stirling engines in their products are refrigeration units, HVAC systems, micro-CHP units, and photovoltaic systems.  Not all these systems use natural gas as their fuel source which makes the Stirling engine a stepping stone into the renewable energy production field.  The market potential is virtually endless with the adaptability of the Stirling engine into almost every energy producing field.
<p>    
    As the world continues to move toward a more renewable energy source StirMoCorp wishes its patent technology will help in the effort.  StirMoCorp is ready to facilitate a paradigm shift in energy production and improve home and industrial efficiency.  It is our intent to make a green tomorrow today.
