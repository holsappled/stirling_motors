    <h2>Our Company</h2> 
    <p>
Stirling Motors Corp. is a green technology start-up that uses a patented design to increase the efficiency and durability of its Stirling cycle motor (StirMoCo) while also decreasing the manufacturing cost of the engine. Liquid pumps, vapor compression, and electrical generation are the primary focus of the product development, especially for combined heat and power (CHP) applications. Flexable fuel, low noise and low emissions, are important features of all Stirling engines, and when combined with our innovations, we will capture a very lucrative market which currently relies on very expensive electricity from the utilities. 
    <p>
The first product release will be a 1.5hp residential pool pump that will fire on natural gas and run at approximately 25% thermal efficiency. This will save the average pool owner about $45 per month in energy costs because natural gas is so inexpensive relative to top tier electrical rates. In addition, the motor / pump will be cooled by the pool water and it will provide between 10-degF and 15-degF warmer water on an average sized pool.      
    <p>
Future product releases will address the m-CHP market where Stirling engines are already in use, and our innovative technology will enhance the system cost and performance. Other opportunities include residential and small commercial HVAC vapor condensing units. 
    <p>
Future short term power plant releases range up to 10 hp for more demanding commercial and industrial applications in this space, while longer term development is planned for a scaled up product release focusing on a 40+% thermal efficiency engine for larger CHP and distributed power generation projects. This will be made possible through the use of high temperature ceramic materials, which the StirMoCo engine has been uniquely designed for.
